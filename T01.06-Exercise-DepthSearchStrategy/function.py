    # First, reduce the puzzle using the previous function
    
    # Choose one of the unfilled squares with the fewest possibilities
    
    # Now use recursion to solve each one of the resulting sudokus, and if one returns a value (not False), return that answer!

    # If you're stuck, see the solution.py tab!
