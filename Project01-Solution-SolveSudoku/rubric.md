| Naked twins implemented correctly.     | The student correctly uses constraint propagation to solve the naked twins problem by enforcing the constraint that no squares outside the two naked twins squares can contain the twin values |
| Diagonal Sudoku implemented correctly. | The student correctly solves the diagonal sudoku using constraint propagation by adding the new constraint of the diagonal sudoku                                                              |
| Unit tests pass.                       |  Both unit tests pass. Run solution_test.py to check.                                                                                                                                          |

| Naked twins implementation understanding.     | In the README.md file, the student has shown an understanding of how constraint propagation has been used to implement the naked twins function, by enforcing the constraint that no squares outside the two naked twins squares can contain the twin values |
| Diagonal Sudoku implementation understanding. | In the README.md file, the student has shown an understanding of how constraint propagation has been used to solve the diagonal sudoku, by adding the diagonals to the set of constraints.                                                                   |

###Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!
Students can personalize their projects further by implementing a few other strategies described [here](http://www.sudokudragon.com/sudokustrategy.htm).
